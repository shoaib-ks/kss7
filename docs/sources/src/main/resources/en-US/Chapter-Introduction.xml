&THIS.PLATFORM; jSS7 (Java SS7) is the only Open Source Java based implementation of the SS7 protocol stack. It comes with JSLEE TCAP, MAP, CAP and ISUP Resource Adaptors (RA) and enables legacy developers to build SS7 
applications with ease. Developers only require an understanding of Resource Adaptors and focus on building applications rather than worry about the SS7 stack. 
&THIS.PLATFORM; jSS7 is compatible with Dialogic boards, dahdi based cards (Diguim and Sangoma) and also has inbuilt support for SIGTRAN (M3UA). &THIS.PLATFORM;  &THIS.APPLICATION; also supports TeleStax SS7 Cards which has 
MTP2/3 support on-board and hence lower processing load on server hosting &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
		</para>
		<para>
Since &THIS.PLATFORM; jSS7 is Java based, it is cross-platform and can be installed and used on any Operating System that supports Java. The Open Source Software gives you the flexibility to understand the readily available source code and customise the product for your Enterprise needs.

    	SS7 (Signaling System No.7) is a set of signaling protocols defined for information exchange in telephony. It is the global standard for telecommunications and is defined by the <ulink url="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/ITU">International Telecommunication Union (ITU) - Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)</ulink>. It is also commonly referred to as Common Channel Signaling System No. 7 (i.e., <acronym>SS7</acronym> or <acronym>C7</acronym>).
		</para>
		<para>
		In telephony (wireless and wireline), the information associated with a call must be exchanged between a telephone and the telephone exchange or between exchanges, transit nodes and other elements in the network. Information exchange is required to set up, control and tear down calls and this exchange of information is called Signaling. SS7 is the global standard that defines the procedures and protocol to be followed by network elements in the Public Switched Telephone Network (<acronym>PSTN</acronym>) in order to exchange information over a digital signaling network to effect wireless (cellular) and wireline call setup, route,control, monitor and terminate.

		The
		ITU definition of SS7 allows for national variants such as the
		American National Standards Institute (<acronym>ANSI</acronym>) and Bell Communications
		Research (Telcordia Technologies) standards used in North America and

		<title>Time Division Multiplexing</title>
		<para>
			In circuit switched networks such as the Public Switched Telephone
			Network (<acronym>PSTN</acronym>) there exists the need to transmit multiple
			subscribers’ calls along the same transmission medium. To accomplish
			this, network designers make use of Time Division Multiplexing<acronym>TDM</acronym>. <acronym>TDM</acronym> allows switches to
			create channels, also known as tributaries, within a transmission
			stream. A standard DS0 voice signal has a data bit rate of 64 kbit/s,
			determined using Nyquist’s sampling criterion. <acronym>TDM</acronym> takes frames of
			the voice signals and multiplexes them into a <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame which runs at
			a higher bandwidth. So if the <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame consists of 'n' voice frames,
			the bandwidth will be n*64 kbit/s.
			Each voice sample timeslot in the <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame is called a channel . In
			European systems, <acronym>TDM</acronym> frames contain 30 digital voice channels, and
			in American systems, they contain 24 channels. Both standards also
			contain extra bits (or bit timeslots) for signaling (SS7) and
			synchronisation bits.
			Multiplexing more than 24 or 30 digital voice channels is called higher order
			multiplexing. Higher order multiplexing is accomplished by
			multiplexing the standard <acronym>TDM</acronym> frames.For example, a European 120
			channel <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame is formed by multiplexing four standard 30 channel
			<acronym>TDM</acronym> frames.At each higher order multiplex, four <acronym>TDM</acronym> frames from the
			immediate lower order are combined, creating multiplexes with a
			bandwidth of n x 64 kbit/s, where n = 120, 480, 1920, etc.
